# _White-Space_

![Logo](./public/static/logo.svg)

**_A one-stop, secure and web3 first platform for web developers to monetize white-space on their websites and advertisers to advertise their products._**

# How we work

- Developers can mint an NFT regarding their whitespace and place a starting price accordingly.

- Developers will be given an embed URL which they will be required to include in their webpages.

- Advertisers can then explore the available white spaces and purchase the NFT.

- Advertisement on the purchased whitespace NFT will be shown in the webpages.
